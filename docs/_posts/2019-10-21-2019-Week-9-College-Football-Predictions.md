title: 2019 Week 9 College Football Predictions
layout: post
excerpt: Riley Patterson's weekly college football game predictions produced from a gradually improving pagerank-based model. Updated with comparisons to actual results as those results come in.

Continuing on [Week 8's analysis of an additional home advantage feature]({{ site.baseurl }}/2019-Week-8-College-Football-Predictions/), let's take a look at week 8 results broken down by model variations:

| Model | Correct Winner | Beat Spread | Beat Over-Under |
|-------|----------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Random Forest baseline | 44-18 | 32-25 | 24-33 |
| Linear Regression with home adv | 47-15 | 30-27 | 22-35 |
| Random Forest with home adv | 43-19 | 32-25 | 26-31 |

The impact of home advantage is looking even more marginal than it did last week. On the bright side, I'm continuing to perform well against the spread, but the over-under (which has always been the weaker part of these models) is looking worse than usual. At this point I'm going to stop showing the multiple model predictions each week, focusing in on the random forest model with home advantage as the main one I present. I am still generating and evaluating predictions for half a dozen different models so that I can run stats on them at the end of the year. If I make major model changes in the meantime, I'll revive the multiple weekly prediction format and explain the differences.

layout: post
excerpt: Riley Patterson's weekly college football game predictions produced from a gradually improving pagerank-based model. Updated with comparisons to actual results as those results come in.

In the past [couple of]({{ site.baseurl }}/Predicting-the-2017-College-Football-Bowl-Season/) [years]({{ site.baseurl }}/2018-College-Football-Bowl-Predictions/), I have shared predictions from my pagerank-based model for the college football bowl season. In each of the linked posts, I also described in some detail how I had improved my model over time. But those are just snapshots -- I have been running predictions for the regular season for years now, and the models and ideas I discuss in the annual bowl predictions posts have resulted from evaluations and improvements throughout the season. This year, now that we've seen three weeks of play and accumulated enough data for my model to produce meaningful results, I plan to start sharing weekly predictions in a format that I can easily update with actual outcomes and performance evaluation. I may from time to time expound on the previous week's predictions' performance and planned or implemented changes to the model. Come December, I will still publish the annual bowl predictions post with a more in-depth discussion of my methodology and how it has changed over time.

For this first post of the year, I merely got last year's model running on this year's data, so if you're interested in technical details, see [the previous bowl predictions post]({{ site.baseurl }}/2018-College-Football-Bowl-Predictions/).

excerpt: Riley Patterson's annual bowl predictions presented from models build off of a pagerank computed on a graph of team victories.

Below are my predictions based on the current model. Coming soon: a model based on full-game simulations by predicting each drive sequentially!

## 2019 Bowl Predictions

These are predictions produced from an evolution of the model that I have been using for years: a random forest regression run independently to produce each team's score in a given game on the following features:
* difference in opponents' pagerank in a graph of past games, with edges from losers to winners weighted by the margin of victory
* average points scored by the team
* average points allowed by the other team
* difference in AP rank of the opponents
